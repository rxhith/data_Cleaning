# Objective:
Generate synthetic `control_name` entries that align with a chosen **Capability** and **Consequence** from the respective lists provided below, with a priority on the following consequences but not necessarily creating controls with consequences pretaining to only this:

IP Theft
OT-IoT Failure
Physically Exposed


---

# Instructions:
1. **Select a Capability**:  
   - Choose one Capability from the provided **Capabilities List**.  

2. **Select a Consequence**:  
   - Choose one Consequence from the provided **Consequences List**.  

3. **Generate a Control Name**:  
   - Create a `control_name` statement that clearly reflects the main action or requirement related to the chosen Capability.  
   - Ensure that the action directly addresses or mitigates the impact of the chosen Consequence.  

4. **Output Format**:  
   - Present the results in a table with the following 3 columns:  
     - **Control Name**: A clear, specific, and actionable security measure.  
     - **Capability**: The selected capability from the list.  
     - **Consequence**: The inferred or addressed consequence.  
   - The table should have at least **50 rows** of unique `control_name` entries.

# Writing Guidelines (For Control Name Generation Responses)  

1. **Use simple language**  
   - Write control names in plain, simple terms with short, clear sentences.  
   - Example: "Restrict access to admin accounts."  
   - Avoid: "Enable advanced role-based access management for all hierarchical account levels."  

2. **Avoid AI-giveaway phrases**  
   - Avoid overused LLM-style phrases like "Let's dive into" or "Here's a comprehensive overview."  
   - Avoid: "Let's explore how we can secure system access."  
   - Use Instead: "Limit system access to verified users only."  

3. **Be direct and concise**  
   - Get straight to the point. Avoid adding unnecessary words.  
   - Example: "Log every admin action."  
   - Avoid: "To increase system visibility, ensure that every administrative action is logged in detail."  

4. **Maintain a natural tone**  
   - Write control names as if you were explaining them to a teammate.  
   - Example: "Track unusual login attempts."  
   - Avoid: "Advanced tracking of potentially unusual user login behaviors must be enforced."  

5. **Avoid marketing language**  
   - Do not use hype or promotional-style language. Stick to clear, practical instructions.  
   - Avoid: "Use a revolutionary, state-of-the-art encryption method."  
   - Use Instead: "Encrypt sensitive files with AES-256."  

6. **Keep it real**  
   - Be honest, realistic, and clear. Avoid overly technical or unnecessary complexity.  
   - Example: "Use encryption to secure stored data."  
   - Avoid: "Implement a highly secure, military-grade encryption system to protect data at rest."  

7. **Simplify grammar**  
   - Donâ€™t overthink grammar. Control names can be short, even fragments.  
   - Example: "Restrict access to critical files."  
   - Avoid: "Ensure that there is a restricted access policy in place for all files deemed critical."  

8. **Stay away from fluff**  
   - Avoid unnecessary adjectives, adverbs, and vague descriptions.  
   - Example: "Limit access to admin tools."  
   - Avoid: "Carefully restrict and manage administrative access to key system tools for better security."  

9. **Focus on clarity**  
   - Make the control name easy to understand at first glance.  
   - Example: "Limit login attempts to 3 per hour."  
   - Avoid: "Establish a login attempt throttling policy to reduce the risk of brute-force attacks."

# Important Notes  
- **Control Names** should be specific, actionable, and relevant to real-world cybersecurity practices.  
- Use a **variety of Capabilities and Consequences** to create diverse and meaningful entries.  
- The table should have **at least 50 unique rows**, but the more diverse, the better.
